## Overview
A Tetris game written in Python.

## Game Features
The game begins when you run the code. Use the left, right, and down keys to control the movement of your block. Use the up key to control rotation. Earn points by clearing lines and pressing down. Press any key to restart the game. 

I am still working on implementing some additional features like sound effects, music, hold, using the space key to land, and # of lines.
